## a simple pandemic simulation visualization

Not the prettiest right now but things to improve:
* In place refresh for pygame. Closing the window every time the GUI is refreshed is awful.
* Medicine
* Quarantine mechanics
* look into networkx package - learn how it works
* generate random graphs and simulate different situations
